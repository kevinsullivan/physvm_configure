# Ubuntu 20.04, Lean Prover 3 Community, mathlib

This directory supports building of a docker
image for using the Lean Prover with mathlib
on an Ubunty 20.04 platform, and pushing it 
to DockerHub (a commercial image registry) so
that others can pull it, exec it, and use it
through VSCode to develop logic/code in Lean. 

Here are the commands needed to buid, push
(to DockerHub), and use our container. We
assume you've already got docker running on
your computer. Make sure that you're logged
in to DockerHub. 

## Build image from Dockerfile

To build a new version of the clean_lean image, 
run the following command in a terminal with this
directory as the current working directory. The
repository image name is kevinsullivan/clean_lean.
It will have the tag, *latest*.
``` sh
docker build -t kevinsullivan/physvm:latest . -m 8g
```

## Push image to DockerHub

To push a copy of this image to dockerhub, do this:
``` sh
docker push kevinsullivan/physvm
```

## Pull image from DockerHub
To pull a copy of the image to your local host machine, run: 
```sh
docker pull kevinsullivan/physvm
```

## Start container
To launch a container using this image run the following command.
Replace %source_directory_on_host% with the host directory you want 
the VM to access as /dm. Replace %container_name% with the name you'd
like to give to the launched docker container. We suggest giving it 
a name that reflects the local directory that is mounted on its
container-local directory, /dm. 
```
docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --rm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --name %container_name% -v %source_directory_on_host%:/dm kevinsullivan/physvm \
    /bin/bash
```

## Get terminal into container
To connect to a terminal shell into the VM, do this:
``` sh
docker exec -it lean /bin/bash
```

## Stop running container
To stop a container from a terminal on your host machine, do this:
``` sh
docker stop lean
```
To stop a running image from a terminal into the container, exit the terminal process:
``` sh
exit
```
